Second project: explaination of limits of study
My computer was limited in its calculating capacity. 
I limited my Neural net to having one layer with 3 nodes. 
I limited my bagging to 5, 6 and higher values for bagging crashed and gave me errors.
Bagging confirmed the accuracy of True predictions, which means the x values are tuned well for the marketing campaign.
